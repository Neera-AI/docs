# Neera White Paper

### What are we building? <a id="docs-internal-guid-b30c87a3-7fff-2446-4065-bc9ce63e101a"></a>

We are building a search marketplace!

There are two key insights to what we are building.

1. The needs from search are immense. You search everywhere and you search all kinds of things. You search for websites, images, infographics, podcasts, news, memes, documents, contacts, emails, and you search for these things everywhere, Google, Github, Reddit, or your personal SaaS applications, say Evernote, Slack and Google.
2. The needs for search are so diverse that no single company can solve search for everyone \(not even Google\). The only way you can solve search is to help people solve it for each other. Thatâ€™s why we need a marketplace/platform model to search.

In Neera, 3rd parties can add search plugin for any usecase they seem fit. The users find information from any of the 100s of search plugins though a unified interface. Even your regular websearch is a plugin in Neera!

Another way to think of Neera, is to think of **Operating System for Search**. From the search sources to the widgets, everything in Neera is "plug and play".
