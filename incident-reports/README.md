# Incident Reports

Use this space to document any downtimes OR incidents. The intention is document "How it happened" and "Why it happened?" so that everyone can learn the lessons and we can improve the system.

Guidelines:
- Try to link to the specific commit or releases which introduced faulty behaviour. Gives pointers for people 
- Do NOT mention any names in the document. The team did whatever it did, good/bad/brilliant/stupid, no single person is responsible for an incident.
- Avoid sounding apologetic. Shit happens, it okay. It's important to ensure that errors don't cascade and we learn from them.
