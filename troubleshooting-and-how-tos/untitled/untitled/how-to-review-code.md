# How to review code?

* **The most important thing is the speed at which ship improvements to customers.**
* Don't block a pull request, unless a change can cause irreversible damage to the company. Everyone will learn faster by shipping bad code and then fixing it, instead to trying to get the perfect code out in the first go.
* Be collaborative. If you see a variable should be named better, rename it. If you think a piece of code should be written slighly differently, rewrite it. If you are reviewer do whatever you can to get the improvements reach the users fast. A good review should feel like a friend who is helping you out than an adversary who isn't letting you go.
