# How to create good commits?

⚠️

Common sense trumps all guidelines. If a guideline is constantly becoming a trouble in getting things done. Call it out, and skip the guideline.

## What does an ideal commit looks like? <a id="f820f8ab-250a-41f5-8246-e8eda01fc7ce"></a>

An ideal commit should "atomic".

* A commit should only do one thing, and shouldn't mix two changes where they don't belong together.
* If you commits are structured well, it is easy to reorder commits and revert commits without worrying about conflicts.
