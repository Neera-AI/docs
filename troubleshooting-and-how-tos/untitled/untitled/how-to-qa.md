### Making Code Changes <a id="c5c896d5-4648-438b-b630-d8e9a0a32e2b"></a>

* Test PRs rigorously before requesting review.
* Include test cases you've checked for in your PR description.

### Reviewing Code <a id="a763c855-55d4-40fe-ba25-f4fa28f3546c"></a>

* If the change is substantial and user-facing, pull down the branch.
* Test for cases \(particularly edge cases\) that the PR author may have missed.

### QA <a id="94682c4e-f3eb-4dea-b75d-7a13b91e9f39"></a>

* Look at the list of items going out for release the next day.
* Go down the list one-by-one and thoroughly test changes.
