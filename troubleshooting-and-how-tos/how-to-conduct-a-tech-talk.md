# How to conduct a tech talk?

## Pre Talk
- [ ] Decide on the topic of the talk with the speaker
- [ ] Decide on a time and date
- [ ] Create a calendar invite
    - Make sure you are the "organizer" of the event, and not the speaker. Otherwise the speaker will have to admin people while giving the talk.
- [ ] Create a poster. You can use [this figma design as a template.](https://www.figma.com/file/A5HkymSa7DQ7qaF9P61q4y/AkTech-Talk-poster?node-id=0%3A1)
    - In case you decide to create a new poster, ensure that it is horizontal, instead of vertical. Works better with Twitter and LinkedIn preview
- [ ] Post the about the talk on Twitter, make sure you:
    - [ ] Add poster
    - [ ] Tag the speaker
    - [ ] Give a meet/calendar 
- [ ] Create an event on LinkedIn with company profile. Share that event with personal profile
- [ ] Share the tweet link and LinkedIn post link on Slack so that your teammates can like and share it.


## During the talk
- [ ] Join 5 minutes early
- [ ] Introduct the speaker and topic
- [ ] Set the time limit
- [ ] Ensure the audience discussion do not deviate too much from the topic
- [ ] At the end, thank the speaker and the audience for joining in.
