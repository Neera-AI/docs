# What is the process?

Every person in the team is required to send an email to the person they report to, answering following questions:

- How did I spend my time this week?
- What was the most fun part?
- What was the most annoying part?
- What was the most impactful thing that I did this week?

This goes for everyone, including Harsh, who sends the reviews to his advisors.

Aim to send the email by Friday, max EOD Sunday

# Why do we need it? What is the intended outcome?

Like the weekly releases. Weekly reviews helps the person, and their manager know what is working and what is not working.

# What are the ways process can fail us?

For people reading the review, it is important that you don't judge the person on their weekly review. Otherwise people will start lying, it will erode trust and will lead to downfall of the organization.

For person writing the review, it is important that you remain honest. The reviews can lead to uncomfortable discoveries, if it does, the review has done its job.

# How will we know the process is working?

If the reviews are pushing us to continuous improvement, we know the process is working.

# How will we know the process is not working?

The process is not working if:

- If we are not being honest in the review
- People are worried more about the weekly review than the work itself
- We are not asking important questions from the review, people should feel free to tweek the template.
