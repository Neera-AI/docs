We will do a public facing release every Thursday. This means:

>>>>>>> fa2c8fe0dab0db9bc5021d9bf4a2b9a8e567105c
- Do a release on Github
- Write a blog post about what changed this week
- Share it on social media

# Why do we need it?
<<<<<<< HEAD
It is important to release frequently. It is important that we release with a predictable cadence. 
Weekly release tell us, and tell the world that things are moving.

# What is the intended outcome?

>>>>>>> fa2c8fe0dab0db9bc5021d9bf4a2b9a8e567105c
Week by week, we will get better, even if it is by a small percentage. Over months and years, these improvements
compound.
We will expect continuous improvement from us, and people will grow to anticipate new changes in Neera every week. Which will add to the momentum.

# What are the ways process can fail us?
<<<<<<< HEAD
The process can fail us if we focus too much on the small changes and ignore the big changes. Though I trust us, that we'll see when this is happening and we will move things around accordingly.

# How will we know the process is working?
We will know it when we see it. We'll hear from someone that they are looking forward to this week's release to see what's new.

# How will we know the process is not working?
Quality of our weekly releases is an indicator of health of our organization and code base. If we feel the release cycle is not working, we need to dig in to the see the reasons. Questions to ask:

>>>>>>> fa2c8fe0dab0db9bc5021d9bf4a2b9a8e567105c
- Has our system become too complicated?
- What are barriers in shipping code?
- Are we talking to users frequently enough to know their problems?

It is unlikely that the release cycle is at fault, and it is unlikely that there is no improvement that we can ship.
<<<<<<< HEAD
A potential failure mode is that we are focusing too much on short term changes and not enough on long term changes. Changing the release cycle doesn't fix that issue, it needs to fixed somewhere else.

# FAQs
## Does this means we only deploy code on Thursdays?
No, we can deploy code anytime of the week, though they will be annoced on Thursdays.

## Why Thursday?
We want to release towards the end of the week. Friday releases are considered bad becase things break and at times they spill over to the weekend.

## What if nothing really happened in the last week?
Well say that in the weekly release note. Not an execuse to not do the weekly release.

## What if I am working on a piece which takes more than a week to complete?
That will happen all the time, though the hope is that at lease someone in the team will be able to release something that week.

## What if I find myself doing small just for sake of doing a release?
Once or twice, its okay, if we are doing it too often, then something is wrong and we need to move things around.

It has been two months since we started doing a release on our company blog. I feel the process is working, things have slowed down in last few weeks and you can see it in the release notes. https://blog.neera.ai/
Also do feel that weekly releases keep a sense of momentum.
