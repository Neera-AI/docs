**Instant apps are the small preview cards which can answer some special search queries. They save you an extra click when you're looking for something instantly.**

Search queries like "define farrago", "time in germany", "video to gif" can and should be "answered" instantly. You should not have to click on a website and navigate it around while closing a series of popups or looking at "your phone has virus" ads.

## FAQs

<details>
  <summary>How are Instant Apps different from Google featured snippets?</summary>

Instant Apps are very similar to <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/reintroduction-googles-featured-snippets/">Google's featured snippets</a>, except

<ul>
  <li>
    Google doesn't let you create them, and they'll probably never do so.{" "}

<summary>How are Instant Apps different from DuckDuckGo's instant answer?</summary>

DuckDuckGo used to host a similar platform called <a href="https://duckduckhack.com">DuckDuckHack</a>. 1500+ of contributors wrote 250,000 lines of code, however the platform is no longer accepting new contributions since 2017.

Also, all the DDG instant answers had to be written in Perl, which is the <em>third most dreaded language in the world.</em> <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-languages-dreaded">Source</a>
