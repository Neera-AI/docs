## Problem Statement


**Create awesome Open Source Instant Apps at [github.com/felvin-search/instant-apps](https://github.com/felvin-search/instant-apps).**

Instant apps are the small preview cards which can answer some special search queries. They save you an extra click when you're looking for something instantly.

Search queries like "define farrago", "time in germany", "video to gif" can and should be "answered" instantly. You should not have to click on a website and navigate it around while closing a series of popups or looking at "your phone has virus" ads.

## FAQs

### Where do I even begin?

- [Overview of Getting Started with Instant Apps](../instant-apps/getting-started.md)
- [GitHub README and contributing guide](https://github.com/felvin-search/instant-apps)
 
### Do the contributions I make during hacktoberfest (outside the hackathon dates) count?
- No. Only the Pull Requests made during the hackathon period (15-17 October) will count.

### Can I pick up existing issues in the repository and work on them or do I have to think about new instant app ideas?
- Yes - you can work on existing issues. Do make sure to comment and say you are working on an issue to avoid submission of multiple pull requests. However, we do encourage thinking of new Instant Apps which could benefit your search experience. :)
