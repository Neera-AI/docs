# All our Engineering documentation will be public

## Decision

All our Engineering documentation will be public, this includes decision, code documenation, dev ops workbooks, architecture diagrams, or anything engineering. Most of the business documentation will be public as well. Hiring/Firing, Financials, or any conversations with 3rd parties won't be public.

This does not mean our code will be open source. All the ideas around it will be public, the specific implementation won't.

## Factors and Context

* We want to have a single place to have all engineering docs
* We want to help people help us, they can't if they don't know what we are doing and how we are doing it. See [https://hargup.substack.com/p/keeping-our-door-open](https://hargup.substack.com/p/keeping-our-door-open)

## Alternatives

* Keep part of documentation public, and part private. This makes it much harded to maintain documentation.

## Expected Outcome

Keeping all our engineering docs will create right forcing functions for the company. Expected Engineering Implications:

* Our documetation will improve. You can be sloppy in internal documentation, but documentation being public sets a different bar all together.
* We will make better engineering decisions because this will enhance our ability to take help.
* Our systems will become more stable and secure. Since we won't be able to rely on security by obscurity. We will have to write our systems in a way that they are secure and stable even if everyone knows how the system works.
* Public documentation will attract better engineers, and will help with hiring.

Business Implications:

* There will be no pretention that engineering IP \(Intellectual Property\) is the moat here. Which will force us to do things better on business side. See also [https://hargup.substack.com/p/memo-ask-what-not-how](https://hargup.substack.com/p/memo-ask-what-not-how)
