# Decisions

This section records all major/minor engineering decisions. Decisions involves, choices on tech stack, choices on tools and or archictectures.

You don't have to be comprehensive while writing decision records, also you don't have to overthink these things. But do write them down! Err on the side of writing more things, than writing less things.
