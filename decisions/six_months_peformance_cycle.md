# 6 month performance cycle

## Decision
We'll use a 6 months performance review cycle, instead of a year long performance cycle. All other administrive things will move at 2x speed. For example, the stock vesting period will be of 2 years, with a 6 months cliff. Instead of a 4 year vesting period with a a 1 year cliff.

## Context
I hired our second intern yesterday. I am in process of raising funds for the company was thinking about stock options for employees and the vesting schedule. Usually in tech companies things are done in a yearly cycle, I think that is too long. A *lot* changes in a year. 

The times have accelerated so should we.


## Factors

Generally thigns are done much faster in the world now.

## Alternatives

A 3 month review cycle and a stock vesting period of 1 year. We can actually do that, but lets try with 6 months thing. 

## Expected Outcome
It will set the pace of the company. Things will be done much faster compared to the competitors.

## Actual Outcome

### 6 month review

### 2 year review

### 5 year review
